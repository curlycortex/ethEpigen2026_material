* I'm away on the 6th of March, and the course will be held online.
&#35; On the 15th of may there is teaching, but since the 14th is a holiday and many people are away, there will be the option to join online and the class will be recorded.

As I am making adjustments to the course this year, the course plan is subject to change.
